1.       DESCRIPTION In   this   assignment   we   study   the basic properties   of three   phase   electrical   systems,   such   as   line   and   phase   voltages,   the   phase   shift   of voltage   and   current,   asymmetry   and   wye/delta   configured   loads.   The pre-lab task   contains   a personal   quiz   and   group preparations   for   the   actual   laboratory measurements,   including the   design   of   the   circuit   diagrams   and measure-   ment   sheets.   In   the   laboratory   we   will   make   measurements   for   wye   and   delta   configured   loads and measure the currents in   an   asymmetric   system.   Finally,   we will   assess   the   results   and   compare   how   different   configurations   (wye/delta)   affect   the   three-phase   system,   how   asymmetric load affects the system and how the results differ   from   calculated   ones.The pre-lab task (both the quiz and the group task) needs to be completed and returned to Moodle before the laboratory session. The   laboratory   task   takes   place   in   room   6318.   After the session, a short   analysis paper   is prepared.

2.       PRE-LAB TASK The pre-lab task consists of   drawing   circuit diagrams.   For   example,   they   can be   made   with ProfiCAD, or   using a   browser-based tool called diagrams.net (previously known as draw.io).   Diagrams.net provides   suitable   stencils for components. They   can be   accessed by   selecting More Shapes from the lower left corner,   and then   selecting Electrical. The   circuit   diagrams   can be made with any tool you find suitable, as long   as   the   finished   diagrams   are   clear.
2.1          Three-phase power measurement in wye configuration Design a circuit diagram with a three-phase voltage source, three-phase load resistor in wye   configuration   and power measurement   from the circuit using three power meters   (watt   me- ters).Design   a   circuit   diagram   for   making   the   same   measurement   using   only   two   power   meters   (line voltages and phase currents are measured, more information can be found by searching   the internet for two wattmeter method. Check the tips in   chapter 4.1.)
2.2          Three-phase power measurement in delta configuration 
Design a circuit diagram with a three-phase voltage source, three-phase load resistor in delta   configuration and power measurements for the circuit using three wattmeters.
2.3 Measurement sheet 
Create measurement sheets for the measurements described in   chapters   3.2-3.4.
3.       MEASUREMENTS 
3.1 Required eqiupment 
1 pc.          3-phase AC power   source   (SM1003)
3 pcs         Variable resistor   100 Ω   npcs         Multimeter
3 pcs         Wattmeter Metrahit 29S
3.2          Three-phase power measurement in wye configuration Build the circuit you designed in   the pre-lab   task   (chapter   2.1).   Adjust 代 写BL10A9030 Laboratory Course in Electrical Engineering
代做程序编程语言  the   three-phase   load resistor   to   100 Ω and the   phase   voltage of   the three-phase supply to 60 V. Connect the   neutral   conductor   to   the   neutral   point   and   measure   the   current   of   the   neutral   conductor.   Document the active power, voltage, current and power factor of   each line and the current of   the neutral   connector to the measurement sheet. What is the power factor stated by the wattmeter?Next, measure   the   three-phase   power   using   only   two   wattmeters.   What   does   the   wattmeter state as the power factor now? Document the active   power, current, voltage and power factor   from the wattmeters to the measurement sheet.
3.3          Three-phase power measurement in delta configuration Build the   circuit you   designed   in the pre-lab task   (chapter   2.2).   Alter   the   circuit   so   that   the   load   resistor   is   connected   in   delta   configuration.   The   voltage   source   and   the   load   resistor   values are   unchanged. Measure the three-phase   power   using three wattmeters. Document the   active power, voltage, current and power factor of   each line to the measurement sheet.
3.4 Asymmetric load Connect   three   variable   resistors   in   wye   configuration   and   add   the   neutral   conductor   to   the   neutral point of   the circuit. Add a current meter to each line and the neutral conductor. With   a low phase voltage (approximately   15 V): Test what happens to the currents of   the lines and   the neutral   conductor when there   is   an   imbalance   in the resistance   of   the   load   in   each   line.   Start   from   an   approximately   symmetrical   situation,   and   then   alter   the   resistance   values   of   the variable resistors. Be careful not to exceed the maximum rated current of each resis- tor! 
Document the   current   for   each phase, when they   all   have   noticeably   different   loads.   Next,   remove the neutral conductor and document the current values again.
4.       ANALYSIS OF RESULTS The   analysis   of   the results   consists   of answering the   questions presented   in the   assignment instruction   document. Including, making   possible   calculations, presentation   of   results   in   an illustrative form. and verbal assessment (for example, observations or conclusions made from   figures).   Assess   whether   the   results   are   reasonable.   If some   of the   results   are   completely   incorrect or inadequate, state this and try   to find   the reason   for the   anomaly.
4.1          Three-phase power in wye and delta configured loads Calculate the total   active power in measurement   3.2   when using   three   and   two   wattmeters,   and the total   active power in measurement   3.3. Compare   your   calculations to   the   measured values.
Tips:
-          Using   three   wattmeters,   the   three-phase   power   is   obtained   by   adding   together   the power from each line
P   =   √3√3Uv   Iv   cos(φ)   =   √3UP   Iv   cos(φ)   =   3Uv   Iv   cos(φ)   =   P1    + P2    + P3-          Using two   wattmeters,   the   30   degree   phase   difference   between   the   line   voltage   and the   current   has   to   betaken   into   account
P   =   UP   Iv   cos(φ   −   30°)   +   UP   Iv   cos(φ   +   30°) =   P1    + P2
4.2 Asymmetric load Present   and   analyze   the   results   of   the   measurement   in   chapter   3.4.   Calculate   the   current   of the   neutral   conductor   based   on   the   phase   currents   and   compare   how   the   calculated   value   differs   from   the   measured   one.   What   happens   in   the   state   of asymmetry   in   a   three-phase   system? How does the lack of   a neutral conductor affect the   situation?
